Lifes work political aspirations the whole works right. But I will bet you cannot tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You have never actually stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling seen that. If I ask you about women you would probably give me a syllabus about your personal favorites. But you cannot tell me what it feels like to wake up next to a woman and feel truly happy. You are a tough kid. And I would ask you about war youd probably throw Shakespeare at me right once more unto the breach dear friends. But youve never been near one. Youve never held your best friends head in your lap watch him gasp his last breath looking to you for help. Id ask you about love youd probably quote me a sonnet. But youve never looked at a woman and been totally vulnerable. Known someone that could level you with her eyes feeling like God put an angel on earth just for you. Who could rescue you from the depths of hell. And you wouldnt know what its like to be her angel to have that love for her be there forever through anything through cancer. And you wouldnt know about sleeping sitting up in the hospital room for two months holding her hand because the doctors could see in your eyes that the terms visiting hours dont apply to you. You dont know about real loss cause it only occurs when youve loved something more than you love yourself. And I doubt youve ever dared to love anybody that much. And look at you... I dont see an intelligent confident man... I see a cocky scared kid. But youre a genius Will. No one denies that. No one could possibly understand the depths of you. But you presume to know everything about me because you saw a painting of mine and you ripped my life apart. Youre an orphan right.";
